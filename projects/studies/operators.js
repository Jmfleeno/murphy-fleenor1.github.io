/*
Operators:

0. Operators allow you to manipulate, compare, and assigne values and variables.

1. There are 5 main types of operators within Javascript.

2. These include assignemnt operators, arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and unary operators.
*/

// 1. Assignment Operators //
/*
Assignment operators assign values to variables
These include assignment(=), additions assignment(+=), subtraction assignment(-=), multiplication assignment(*=), division assignment(/=), remainder assignment(%=), and exponentiation assignment(**=) 
*/

// 2. Arithmetic Operators //
/*
Arithmetic operators are used to pre fore arithmetic on numbers
These include addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), exponentiation(**), division(/), remainder/modulus(%), increment(++), and decrement(â€”)
The addition operator(+) and the addition assignment operator(+=) can also be used to concatenate strings
If a string is added to a number the number becomes a string
*/

// 3. Comparison Operators //
/*
Comparison operators compare two values in a variety of ways
These include equal(==), equal value and type(===), not equal(!=), not equal value or type(!==), greater than(>), less than(<), greater than or equal to(>=), less than or equal to(<=), and ternary operator(?)
*/

// 4. Logical Operators //
/*
Logical operators allow you to compare multiple things at once.
These include logical and(&&), logical or(||), and logical not(!)
*/

// 5. Unary Operators (!, typeof, -) //
/*

*/

// Ternary Operators (a ? b: C) //
